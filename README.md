## Final Thoughts :
Had a great time building this application.

Initially when adding & deleting exisiting and new classes, I was under the impression that I had to edit & write over the original classes.js file (like a POST/PUT/PATCH request). But quickly realized that I should keep things a tad simpler & prioritize Front-End functionality.

Would've loved to implement a couple of stretch features such as an edit button to edit the classes that were created. Perhaps an image search by dimension. Oh! and would've loved to do something with the classType data perhaps to differenciate & show some kind of indication that a class was live or for download.

Regardless,
Hope you enjoy !
